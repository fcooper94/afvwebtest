- <b>What happens if I do not upgrade my client? Can I still use the current voice?</b>
    - Unfortunately no. The current system is not compatible with <i>Audio for VATSIM</i> and is being retired. You will not be able to use voice on VATSIM unless you upgrade.
- <b>Can I still fly Text only or Receive only?</b>
    - Yes, all current modes of flying on VATSIM are supported.
- <b>Will AFV work with my audio routing solution (e.g. Virtual Audio Cable)?</b>
    - As <i>Audio for VATSIM</i> is just a change to the codec you should still be able to use an audio routing program as you currently do. However the AFV team will not provide support for them. 
- <b>Do I need a new microphone/headset?</b>
    - Not if it currently works with VATSIM. As voice quality is much higher, you may desire one so we can hear your beautiful voice more clearly!
- <b>Why is my preferred client not included in the upgrade?</b>
    - Our legacy clients like <i>Squawkbox</i>, <i>FSInn</i>, <i>ASRC</i>, etc... have served us very well over the years but they are no longer supported by their developers. As <i>Audio for VATSIM</i> requires significant changes to the clients, we now must retire these clients.
- <b>Another user just asked me to adjust my microphone. What does that mean?</b>
    - <i>Audio for VATSIM</i> requires you to calibrate your microphone within the client you are using. Please go to the settings and adjust the microphone gain slider until you can talk with most of your speech within the green band.
- <b>Why canâ€™t I hear my voice back during the microphone calibration?</b>
    - Playing your voice back to yourself is actually not a very reliable way of setting audio levels. Ensuring your speech is peaking mostly in the green area of the meter is by far the most reliable way to ensure consistent results.
- <b>Why are some pilots/controllers louder than others?</b>
    - <i>Audio for VATSIM</i> Simulates VHF ranges, so the further away from another pilot or controller you are, the less you may be able to hear them or the more static you may hear in a transmission. If you believe you are sufficiently in range, they have not set up their volume correctly. You could advise them to change it in the settings.
- <b>Are 8.33 kHz frequencies supported?</b>
    - <i>Audio for VATSIM</i> has the capability to support 8.33 kHz but unfortunately <i>Simconnect</i> for FS9, FSX, and P3D does not. Should that change in the future we will certainly implement it!
- <b>I am an addon developer and I want to integrate AFV into my software.</b>
    - Contact <a href="mailto:vpdev@vatsim.net">vpdev@vatsim.net</a>.
- <b>I love <i>Audio for VATSIM</i> and I want to do something in return.</b>
    - As with everything on VATSIM this is totally free to the users.
