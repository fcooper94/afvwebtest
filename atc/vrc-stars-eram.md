You will need to update your client to its latest version and download the <i>Audio for VATSIM</i> standalone client to use voice at launch.<BR> The standalone client can be downloaded here on the 11th October.<BR>

<i>(Full integration is expected shortly after launch as some ATC-specific features will need to be coded into the clients and we do not want to delay release of Audio for VATSIM for these features)</i>
