# Euroscope


- 

You will need to update <i>Euroscope</i> to its latest version and download the <i>Audio for VATSIM</i> standalone client to use voice at launch. The standalone client can be downloaded from this website from the 11th October.<BR>

A Euroscope plugin to enable the standalone VCCS to sync text channels and configure ATIS will also be required. This will also be available on the 11th October.<BR>

<i>(Full integration is expected shortly after launch as some ATC-specific features will need to be coded into the clients and we do not want to delay release of Audio for VATSIM for these features)</i>
